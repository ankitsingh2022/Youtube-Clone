# YouTube Homepage Clone

[![Project Status: Completed](./images/badges/status.svg)](./)

> A simple clone of the YouTube homepage made using HTML and CSS.

I followed a [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev) and this was the main project of the course.
